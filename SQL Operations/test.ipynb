    "- This SQL query calculates the number of customers for different combinations of gender and country. The CUBE function in the GROUP BY clause generates aggregate results not only for each unique combination of gender and country but also for subtotals (e.g., total customers per gender regardless of country, total customers per country regardless of gender) and a grand total of all customers. The results are then ordered by country."
